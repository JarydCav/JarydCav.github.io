<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<p>For my project idea I would like to make a Video Game using the unity engine, this Game will be a single player historical strategy game that will show how Vikings managed to live their lives. This project will interesting and useful because it will showcase much of the Vikings history that most people would not be familiar with, when it comes to Gamers around the world there have been many people wanting more games set in the Viking era and this game will fix that. This Video Game will be similar to the popular Assassins Creed Series where as in the characters and people in the world will be fictional and made up but the world and places the game takes place in will be based of real historical places that existed during the Viking era, The Story will be about a Viking King name Raidis and his people as they raid and pillage their way across the continent of Europe in the hopes that they can thrive in the ever changing world. The game will show the player what a Viking town looked like back in those times and will also have some text dialogue that will help the player make small and major decisions that will contribute towards their power ranking and how, the game will also have a system that will allow the player to build buildings within your town and these buildings will help you improve your town by giving you stuff for example if you build a bank it will give money over time and if you build a mine it will give you resources over time and the player will also be able to upgrade these buildings so they have an increased money and resource output , the game will also have a system that will measure how much popularity you have with your own people and if it is high enough you will get increased money and resources from buildings like mines and banks and if your popularity is low enough people will start to leave your town and will end up joining the enemies towns and you will not be able to get them back, the game will also  have a feature that will allow you to build up Raidis town and army to get an overall power ranking for your town and then you can challenge AI or other players with their own towns power rankings and the game will measure who has the higher power and they will be the victor and will earn rewards for winning, The player will get more rewards depending on how close the power ranking was between the player and the AI/other player, such rewards for winning will be more gold and resources to help improve your town and its power ranking even more. The game will have a minor story as where Raidis and his people will come across another unknown Viking and will have to fight them to see which one will be the victor and which one will be wiped from the history books, for historical accuracy Raidis and his people will be the one to lose that will be my explanation for why Raidis is not a historical Viking king because he and his people were wiped out by the other Viking, this other waking will the famous Viking king Ragnar Lodbrok. The tools I will be using are Unity which will be used to develop the games engine and physics system and I will be using a variety of free games tools and calculations to make the game run as best as possible. The skills that will be required to complete this project will be that you will need to understand how using the Unity engine works and how to develop a game for it for this project the people involved will also need to have good communication skills so they can talk to one another and be able to make sure this project is as successful as possible. If this project is successful, then there will be a decent historically accurate Viking strategy game that will help to inform people of what being a Viking was like during those times, if the project is ever made and finished it would be sold for around $10 3 which would be a reasonable amount of money for the amount of time that would be put into its development.<p>
