<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<p>For my project idea I would like to make a Video Game using the unity engine, this Game will be a singleplayer historical strategy game that will show how vikings managed to live thier lives. This project will interesting and useful because it will showcase much of the vikings history that most people would not be familar with, when it comes to Gamers around the world there have been many people wanting more games set in the viking era and this game will fix that. This Video Game will be similar to the popular Assassins Creed Series where as in the characters and people in the world will be fictional and made up but the world and places the game takes place in will be based of real historical places that existed during the viking era, The Story will be about a viking King name Raidis and his people as they raid and pillage there way across the continent of Europe in the hopes that they can thrive in the ever changing world. The game will have a feature that will allow you to build up Raidis town and army to get an overall power ranking for your town and then you can challenge AI or other players with their own towns power rankings and the game will easure who has the higher power and they will be the victor and will earn rewards for winning, The player will get more rewards depending on how close the power ranking was between the player and the AI/other player, such rewards for winning will be more gold and resources to help improve your town and its power ranking even more. The game will have a minor story as where Raidis and his poeple will come across another unknown Viking and will have to fight them to see which one will be the victor and which one will be wiped from the history books, for historical accuracy Raidis and his people will be the one to lose that will be my explanation for why Raidis is not a historical viking king because he and his people where wiped out by the other viking, this other wiking will the famous viking king Ragnar Lodbrok. The tools I will be using are Unity which will be used to develop the games engine and physics system and I will suing a variety of free games tools and calculations to make the game run as best as possible. The skills that will be required to complete this project will be that you will need to understand how using the Unity engine works and how to develop a game for it. If this project is succesfull then there will be a decent historically accurate Viking strategy game that will help to inform people of what being a viking was like during those times.<p>
